## Gameplay
- The movement feels terrible, add stuff like coyote time and buffering jump before hitting the floor
- Endless mode?
- Saves (if endless)
- (maybe not needed) Falling rocks/something to stop the player from just standing in the same balloon the whole game
- Rocks that come from the side?
- More enemies
- ~~Make the game end after a timer/keep track of time alive (we can have an endless mode option too maybe)~~
- ~~SPEED UP BIRD SPAWN/SPAWN MORE BIRDS OVER TIME!! (maybe on each bar of signal gained?)~~
- ~~Feedback when enemy hits balloon (will probably come with sprites, both for enemy attack and hopefully visibly showing in the balloon how destroyed it is with holes or sth)~~
