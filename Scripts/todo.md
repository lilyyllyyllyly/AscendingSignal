## Gameplay
- Tweak variables one last time (the game is too hard rn)
- Endless mode?
- Saves (if endless)
- The movement feels terrible, add stuff like coyote time and buffering jump before hitting the floor
- Rocks that come from the side? (probably not)
- More enemies (probably not)
- ~~(maybe not needed) Falling rocks/something to stop the player from just standing in the same balloon the whole game~~
- ~~Make the game end after a timer/keep track of time alive (we can have an endless mode option too maybe)~~
- ~~SPEED UP BIRD SPAWN/SPAWN MORE BIRDS OVER TIME!! (maybe on each bar of signal gained?)~~
- ~~Feedback when enemy hits balloon (will probably come with sprites, both for enemy attack and hopefully visibly showing in the balloon how destroyed it is with holes or sth)~~

## Art/Visual
- Make balloons fall instead of disappear
- Show balloon health visually (or at least make health text more visible)
- Better background (parallax and stuff, maybe bigger too)
- Clouds that fly by
- Little phone next to signal text
- ~~Rocks (if we add them)~~

## Impact
- Damage flash (birds and balloons)
- Shoot particles
- Bird death particles
- Walk particles
- Land particles
- Shoot knockback?
- ~~Screenshake~~

## Sounds
- Button beep
- Bird spawn/death (would probably have to be a realistic bird sound, not sure if it would fit with the 8 bit sounds, maybe turn on 8 bit filter in import settings?)
- Music (i literally dont know how we would get music)
- ~~Sound system~~
- ~~Jump~~
- ~~Shoot~~
